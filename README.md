## Remco Stoeten personal docs

This is my own documentation site, version 2.0 as I previously had [snippets.remcostoeten.com](https://github.com/remcostoeten/snippets.remcostoeten) which was more a snippet storage without any thoughts and a 
Ô∏è‚Äç`üî•` mess. 

Here I will be storing components I've created which I often re-use, am proud of or just want to store. Same goes for snippets code related, whether it's my Wq
`.zshrc`, a `tsconfig` or a `server actions`. 

#### Technologies
- NextJS 15
- React 19
- Furmadocs
- Markdown
- My own roled, _[library-less authentication](https://github.com/remcostoeten/nextjs-15-roll-your-own-authentication)_
- Mostly custom components
- Eventually will integrate either `sqlite` or `postgresql` for a custom cms.
